      <p>
        As a software engineer student with a passion for programming since a
        young age, I have gained in-depth knowledge of various technologies,
        including NodeJS, Java, Spring, Express, SQL, Angular, Docker, Git, and
        much more. I have worked on several personal projects that have allowed
        me to develop my skills and apply my knowledge as a software engineer. I
        am eager to use my expertise in developing innovative solutions and
        contributing to the growth of the world.
